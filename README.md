# ALOK KUMAR Portfolio

I'm a passionate web developer who loves turning ideas into interactive websites. I enjoy working with modern technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Most of my learning comes from building real projects and exploring new tools. I'm always looking to improve and build cool things on the web!
